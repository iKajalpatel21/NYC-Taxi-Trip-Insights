# 🚖 NYC Taxi Trip Insights

Hi there! 👋  
Welcome to my project for **CSCI 6444 – Introduction to Big Data and Analytics (Fall 2024)** at **George Washington University**.

This notebook dives deep into millions of New York City taxi rides to uncover patterns, make predictions, and understand urban movement using real-world data.

## 📌 About the Project

The NYC Taxi Trip Dataset is one of the largest open datasets out there for transportation analysis. It includes everything from pickup/drop-off locations and timestamps to fare amounts, tip values, and payment types — making it a goldmine for data analysis and machine learning.

In this project, I explored:

- Where and when NYC taxi demand is highest 🗺️
- How long a trip might take ⏱️
- Whether passengers are more likely to pay with card or cash 💳💵
- How trip features affect fare and tip predictions 💰
- What factors contribute to traffic or pricing trends 🚦

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Google Colab** – for running and sharing the notebook
- **Python** – the main language
- **Pandas / PySpark** – for handling large-scale data
- **Scikit-learn (sklearn)** – for modeling and machine learning
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – for visualizations
- **Parquet format** – for efficient data storage and loading
